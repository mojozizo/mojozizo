## 🎯 What I'm About

I'm a full-stack developer who accidentally fell down the ML rabbit hole and never came back up. Currently neck-deep in my thesis project while maintaining a healthy obsession with backend optimization and automation. 

**The vibe:** Write code that actually works, contribute to open-source and occasionally convince AI models to do my bidding.

## 🔥 What I'm Cooking

### 🧠 NetMind (Thesis Project - In Progress)
AI-powered network operations agent that's smarter than your average monitoring tool. Features:
- **Hybrid LLM Architecture**: Llama 3.3 70B for reasoning + Scout 17B for data crunching
- **AutoML Magic**: AutoGluon-powered predictions that actually make sense
- **Honest AF**: System tells you when it can't help instead of hallucinating answers
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, LangChain, ChromaDB, Docker
- **Real-world Impact**: 60-70% token optimization while maintaining quality

*Because network ops shouldn't require a PhD to predict connection failures.*

### 💬 Real-time Chat System (Go)
Building a blazing-fast chat backend because JavaScript is nice, but Go makes things *go* fast.

### 🗣️ Language Learning App
Making language learning less painful, one flashcard at a time.

## 🛠️ Arsenal

**Languages I Abuse Daily:**  
`Python` `Go` `JavaScript/TypeScript` `SQL`

**Frameworks That Tolerate Me:**  
`FastAPI` `React` `Node.js` `LangChain`

**ML/AI Shenanigans:**  
`AutoGluon` `Scikit-learn` `Pandas` `ChromaDB` `LLM Orchestration`

**DevOps (Because Nothing Ever "Just Works"):**  
`Docker` `Docker Compose` `Git` `Linux`

## 📊 The Numbers Game

*Yes, I know there's probably too much Python Notebooks. No, I will not stop.*

## 💡 Currently Learning

- How to make LLMs stop hallucinating (ongoing battle)
- Network performance prediction without breaking the token bank
- Why my Docker containers always fail on first build (mysteries of the universe)
